**ie_pandas** is a group project.

The environment *only_np.yml* has been prepared with Python 3.7  and the package Numpy 1.16.2 only, to avoid uncontrolled dependencies during development.  

Once the environment installed in Anaconda, it should be activated with `conda activate only_np`.  

To install the package, navigate to the directory *ie_pandas* with `cd`, then run `pip install --editable .`. Check if the package has been installed using `conda list`.  

To re-install the package, use `pip install -e .`.

To import the package in Python, use `from ie_pandas.DataFrame import *`.
